<p>
	Adapters act as the glue between collections, models, and views and a backend data source. For the majority of the time you'll never need to interact with the adapter directly. Instead, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/model#sync">Falcon.Model.sync()</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/collection#sync">Falcon.Collection.sync()</a> will call the adapter's sync method when saving/updating data.  Additionally, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/view#initialize">Falcon.View's constructor</a> will call the adapter's getTemplate method to fetch a template's HTML.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>By default, Falcon's base adapter does not make any requests to a backend data source.</strong> Instead, if you're intending to utilize a backend, you should also include one of the adapters from the <a href="#List_of_Adapters">List of Adapters</a>. If you need a more customized experience, then feel free to write your own!
</p>
<p>
	If you do decide to write your own adapter, please take note of a few rules of thumb:
	<ul>
		<li>Utilize <code>Falcon.Adapter.extend({})</code> to create a custom adapter from the base adapter</li>
		<li>You should always override the sync() method but still call the base Falcon.Adapter sync method. The base Falcon.Adapter sync method returns an object of resolved and standardized options, callback context, request type, and the input data object. Additionally, the returned object from the base sync method, also returns an 'is_valid' flag. If this is set to false, then your custom implementation should not continue as it means that a model's validations failed as part of a POST (create) or PUT (save) routine.
		</li>
		<li>If you're looking to utilize your data source to also serve up View templates, then you may also want to override the getTemplate method</li>
		<li>After defining your custom adapter, you should also initilize it and assign it to the <code>Falcon.adapter = new MyCustomAdapter();</code> configuration. The Falcon.adapter configuration is utilized throughout the application in Falcon.Model.sync(), Falcon.Collection.sync() and the Falcon.View constrcutor (for fetching a template with getTemplate).</li>
	</ul>
</p>

	Below is a list of the currently supported adapters.  These should be included directly after Falcon and must be included in order to communicate with a backend data source.

					<li><strong>dataType</strong> - The data type of the request, default is 'json'.</li>
					<li><strong>contentType</strong> - The return data type of the response, default is 'application/json'.</li>
					<li><strong>params</strong> - Query string parameters to append to the url.</li>
					<li><strong>headers</strong> - An object of additional headers to send with the request.</li>

<p>
	This is the core method that Adapters provide which is called by both the Falcon.Model.sync() and Falcon.Collection.sync() methods.  This method takes a set of unresolved and non-standard options and passes them through the various different adapter methods to determine the request type, provide standardized options, and determines a callback context. Additionally, this method will run any model validations if we're executing a PUT or POST request against a model.
</p>
<p>
	By itself, this base implementation does not make any requests to a backend data source.  Instead, it is up to you, the developer, to choose an implemntation specific adapter that suites your needs (or write your own).  Please refer to the <a href="#About_Adapters">'About Adapters'</a> section to get a list of current adapter implementations.  To be more clear, this base adapter class provides the ground work for making and responding to requests, but the actual communication between the front-end application and your data source is provided by adapters who inherit from this base class. For example, if you're using jQuery to connect to a RESTful API with JSON data, then you may want to look at the jQuery Adapter.
</p>
<p>
	Internally, this method will throw an exception if the input data_object isn't a Falcon.Model or Falcon.Collection. If the type checking passes, then this method begins by resolving the request type (<a href="#resolveRequestType">resolveRequestType</a>). Following this, it standardizes the options (<a href="#standardizeOptions">standardizeOptions</a>) with the resolved request type and then we resolve the context (<a href="#resolveContext">resolveContext</a>) with both the resolved request type and standardized options.  Lastly, if the data object is a Falcon.Model and our request type is "POST" or "PUT", we check to ensure that the model is valid by executing the model validate() method.  This method finishes by returning an object of the input data object (data_object), the resolved request type (type), the standardized options (options), the resolved callback context (context), and whether the model is valid or not (is_valid). No actual request to a backend is made.
