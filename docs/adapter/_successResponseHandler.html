<p>
	Method used to handle success responses. This will parse the raw response data, present the raw data to the data_object's parse() method, and then use that parsed data to call the data_object's fill() method with the parsed_data and fill options (if specified).  This method will also trigger a "fetch" event on GET, "create" event on POST, "save" event on PUT, and "destroy" event on DELETE all with the parsed_data being the trigger arguments. Finally, this method will call the success callback on the given context and with the data_object, raw response data, standardized options, and response_args as its arguments.

	This method is a post-request method that should always be called with the same five arguments: data_object, type, options, and context, response_args.

	This method does not do anything by itself and should be overridden by an inheritting adapter implementation.
