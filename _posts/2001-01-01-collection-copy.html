<dl>
	<dt data-type="Object">attributes</dt>
	<dd>An object (or an array which will be converted to an object) of attributes to copy from each model in this collection. If this is not provided, only the id of each model is carried into the new collection.</dd>
	<dt data-type="Falcon.Model">parent</dt>
	<dd> An override of the parent to set in the resultant collection. If 'null' is explicitly given, then the resultant collection will be parent-free</dd>
</dl>
<p>
	Method used to create a copy (similar to the clone method) of this collection and it's models. This method is useful for only selecting certain attributes from each of the models in the collection.  If a parent is given, then the resultant collection will have that parent rather than this collection's parent. If 'null' is given for parent, then the resultant model will have no parent set.
