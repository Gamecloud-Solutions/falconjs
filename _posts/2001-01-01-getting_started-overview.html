<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p>
	Falcon was created to help organize Knockout.js applications. Anyone who's worked with Knockout knows how powerful and simple it is to create dynamic documents with its powerful data binding architecture. However, when creating larger scale applications, Knockout can still fall into the same trap that is seen throughout most Javascript development. It's tough to organize applications in a sensible and scalable way.  Falcon's goal is to aid this problem by providing a way of organizing your data objects and views.

	<strong>Models</strong> can be used to define specific data objects and how they relate to their counterparts on a backend server.
