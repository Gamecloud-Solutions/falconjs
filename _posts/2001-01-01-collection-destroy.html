<p>
	Method used to both remove a model from this collection and delete it on the server. This method takes either an iterator, a model id, or a model to look up an existing model within this collection. If a model is given, it does not need to be the same instance of any model in this collection but rather an identical model based on its 'id'. If no models are found, then null is returned.  If the delete method from the server fails, this method does not remove anything from the collection.
