	<dd>An optional parent to set in the resultant collection. If 'null' is set, then the resultant collection will be parent-free</dd>
</dl>
<p>
	This method does a shallow clone of this collection with the resultant collection containing the same model instances as the original collection. Optionally, if the parent argument is set, the resultant collection will reference that as its parent. If the parent argument is explicitly set to 'null' then the resultant collection will be parent-free.
