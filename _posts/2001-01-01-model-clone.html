<dl>
	<dt data-type="Falcon.Model">parent</dt>
	<dd>An optional parent to assign to the new clone. If 'null' is explicitly given, then the clone will not have a parent. If no parent is given, then by default, the new model inherits this model's parent.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
	Creates a clone of the current model. This method has the ability to also update the parent on the cloned model. If 'null' is explicitly given for the parent argument, then the cloned model will be parent-free.
