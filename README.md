## Change Log
**v0.8.0**
* Separated Knockout source code from Falcon
* Updated Falcon to work with Knockout 3
* Added Falcon.getBinding() method
* Allowed Falcon.addBinding() to take just a key and function (as opposed to a key and an object). If a function is given, it's set as the new binding's 'update' key
