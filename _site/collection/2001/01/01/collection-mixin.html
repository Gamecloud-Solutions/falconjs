</dl>
<p>
	Adds attributes and functions to all of the current and future models in the collection.  This is especially useful for adding one-off functions or observables where needed on each item in the collection that isn't really necessary for everytime this specific collection is created. A good example of this would be adding a 'deleteing' flag to each current and future model in the collection to signify if the model is currently being deleted (hence allowing us to show a loader and ignore any additional delete requests).
