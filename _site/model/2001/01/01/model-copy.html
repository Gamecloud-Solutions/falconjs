<dl>
	<dt data-type="Object">attributes</dt>
	<dd>An object (or an array which will be converted to an object) of attributes to copy from this model to the new model. If this is not provided, only the id of this model is carried into the new model.</dd>
	<dt data-type="Falcon.Model">parent</dt>
	<dd> An override of the parent to set in the resultant model. If 'null' is explicitly given, then the resultant model will be parent-free</dd>
</dl>
<p>
	Method used to create a copy (similar to the clone method) of this model. This method is useful for only selecting certain attributes from this model.  If a parent is given, then the resultant model will have that parent rather than this model's parent. If 'null' is given for parent, then the resultant model will not have a parent.
