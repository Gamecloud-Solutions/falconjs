	Alright, on to the actual Falcon tutorial. As you can see, the code written with Knockout, although very dynamic, doesn't have much structure or organization around it. This can lead to a large mess of code as a project grows from being a very simple application. This is where Falcon steps in.  It adds structure to Knockout so that you can have both well organized and easily maintainable code with the dynamics of Knockout.
</p>
<p>
	To demonstrate how Falcon adds better organization to Knockout, we'll start with a traditional todo list example.  Here you'll see how Falcon can be used to add, remove, and complete todos on a todo list. This also allows us to edit the title and description of the todo list.  In these examples, I've written comments around areas of interest describing how everything is working in the code. Be sure to look through all of the tabs in the jsFiddle to get a full understanding of everything.

	A few key things to pay attention for are <strong>Models</strong>, <strong>Collections</strong>, <strong>Views</strong>, the <strong>Falcon.apply()</strong> method, and the <strong>$view</strong> binding context (in the html template).
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Model</strong> - Represents a single object (such as an Animal, Automobile, or a single Todo)
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Collection</strong> - Represents a list of models (such as an Animals, Automobiles, or multiple Todos)
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>View</strong> - Handles the interaction between models, collections and other application logic and binds everything to a specified knockout template.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Falcon.apply()</strong> - This is the single method that must be called to ininitialize Falcon and your app. The first argument must be a Falcon View that will be bound against, by default, the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>  of the document. Optionally, you may pass in a second parameter to specify what element on the page we would like to ininitialize our application in. In this example we use the <code>#application</code> element.  This will trigger the specified view to load its html template and inject it into our app's container element.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>$view</strong> - This is a new binding context (like knockout's $root, $parent, and $data) added by Falcon to give your templates direct access to a view's methods and variables regardless of what scope you're currently in.  By default, the root level scope of a view's template is the view itself. However, if you're within a 'foreach' binding, then instead of having to call $parent to access the view, you can simply us $view itself.  To get a better understanding of how this is implemented, look at the html tab in the jsFiddle below.
